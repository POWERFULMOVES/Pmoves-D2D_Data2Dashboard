# Project Adaptation Tasks

## Objective

Adapt the project to be compatible with multiple LLM backends (Ollama, LM Studio, Hugging Face, Google Edge) by refactoring the code to use a unified LLM factory.

## Completed Steps

- Created `agents/llm_factory.py` with a `get_llm` function.
- Modified agent files (`d2insight_gpt4o.py`, `d2insight_gpt4o_domain.py`, `d2insight_agent_sys.py`) to use `llm_factory` and environment variables for backend configuration.
- Added basic implementation for Ollama and LM Studio in `llm_factory.py`.
- Added placeholder for Hugging Face and Google Edge in `llm_factory.py`.

## Next Steps for Implementation

1.  **Implement Hugging Face backend:** Replace the placeholder in `agents/llm_factory.py` with code that loads a Hugging Face model using `transformers` and `langchain_community.llms.HuggingFacePipeline`. Include instructions on how to specify the model and any necessary pipelines.
2.  **Implement Google Edge backend:** Replace the placeholder in `agents/llm_factory.py` with code that integrates with the Google Edge library (assuming one is available). Provide guidance on how to configure credentials and specify the model.
3.  **Handle API Differences:** Address variations in API calls, response formats, and capabilities among the different backends. This may involve adding abstraction layers or conditional logic.
4.  **Enhance Configuration:** Implement a more robust configuration system (e.g., using a config file like `config.yaml` or `settings.py`) to manage LLM settings, including backend, model name, API keys, and any backend-specific parameters.
5.  **Explore Ollama "Thinking Models":** Investigate how to leverage Ollama's "thinking models" feature, if relevant to the agent's workflow. This might involve specific prompting strategies or model configurations when using the Ollama backend.
6.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of the project with each implemented backend to ensure correct functionality and performance.

## Instructions for the Next Agent

Your task is to continue the adaptation of this project for multiple LLM backends. Refer to the "Project Adaptation Tasks" document (TASK.md) for the overall plan and completed steps.

Your first priority is to implement the Hugging Face backend in `agents/llm_factory.py` as described in the "Next Steps for Implementation" section.

Once you have completed the Hugging Face implementation, move on to the next step outlined in TASK.md.
