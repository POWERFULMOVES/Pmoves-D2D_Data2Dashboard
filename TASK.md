# Project Adaptation Tasks

## Objective

Adapt the project to be compatible with multiple LLM backends (Ollama, LM Studio, Hugging Face, Google Edge) by refactoring the code to use a unified LLM factory.

## Completed Steps

- Created `agents/llm_factory.py` with a `get_llm` function.
- Modified agent files (`d2insight_gpt4o.py`, `d2insight_gpt4o_domain.py`, `d2insight_agent_sys.py`) to use `llm_factory` and environment variables for backend configuration.
- Added basic implementation for Ollama and LM Studio in `llm_factory.py`.
- Added placeholder for Hugging Face and Google Edge in `llm_factory.py`.
- Implemented Hugging Face backend in `llm_factory.py`.
- Implemented Google Edge backend in `llm_factory.py`.
- Converted remaining agent files (`d2insight_gpt4o.py`, `d2insight_agent_sys.py`) to use `llm_factory` and environment variables.
- Added `config.yaml` and `config.py` to provide a unified configuration system with environment-variable overrides.
- Enhanced `llm_factory.get_llm` to accept API keys and base URLs, addressing backend-specific differences.
- Updated agent files to use `config.get_default_llm` for consistent configuration handling.
- Added `ChatOllamaThinking` wrapper and configuration option to enable Ollama's thinking mode.

## Next Steps for Implementation

1.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of the project with each implemented backend to ensure correct functionality and performance.

## Instructions for the Next Agent

Your task is to continue the adaptation of this project for multiple LLM backends. Refer to the "Project Adaptation Tasks" document (TASK.md) for the overall plan and completed steps.

Your next priority is to address API differences and configuration improvements as described in the "Next Steps for Implementation" section.

Once you have completed those, continue working through the remaining tasks in TASK.md.
